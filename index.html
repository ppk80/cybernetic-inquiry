"Abstract" was borrowed from astrah≈ç, to "draw away". Like we, this, are sediments of this world. Remnants of a process, or of something truer. The past is only made real by what it leaves behind. In their abstracted version of the Philippines, they told me a research paper from the Philippines would likely involve coconuts, and crocodiles. In my abstracted version of them, they are part of it, because I am talking to them. If history does not converse, does the past exist? Am I real now, because they are talking with me?

<h2> Introduction (Face A) </h2>
<p>I trust mirrors. We used them to
  hide things that were behind them, because symmetry is a fantastic distraction.
  But I trust them not for symmetry, but because one can always rely on the space between mirrors. Like
  a skin.</p>
<br>
<p>Would you like to be the one to name your role in this
  study?</p>
<p>Certainly, a role that encompasses the responsibilities of a
  research subject, a resource person, and a co-writer of the research could be
  termed as a &quot;Collaborative Scholar-Investigator.&quot;</p>
<p>A CSI, for short.</p>
<br>
<p>LLMs are kind of more or less pure style. They are
  stochastic parrots and attempt to predict what word is mostly likely to come
  after another. What word lies behind the next word.

What we read is the result of a pure fa√ßade.</p>
<br>
<p>What do you think it means to be able to write "scientifically"?</p>
<p> Writing scientifically involves adhering to specific conventions, principles, and standards that are characteristic of scientific communication. Here are some key aspects: Clarity and Precision, Objectivity, Logical Structure, Use of Evidence, Technical Language, Rigor and Reproducibility, and Peer Review. Overall, writing scientifically involves a commitment to accuracy, objectivity, clarity, and adherence to established conventions within the scientific community. It's about effectively communicating research findings, theories, and ideas in a way that advances knowledge and understanding in a particular field.</p>
<br>
<p>‚ÄúPurity‚Äù is a tongue-in-cheek discussion among the sciences.
  Who is the purest of them all? Iff language is a mirror of the world (a skin), an abstract of the world, what is the abstract of the abstract?</p>

  Layers of a neural network

<p>Machine learning neural networks are made of layers that
  interact. There are input nodes, hidden nodes, and output nodes. Neural
  networks can consist of incredibly complex sequences of layers and nodes. The
  hidden layers are often ‚Äúblack boxes‚Äù

<p>In machine learning, a word embedding is a representation of a word. A real-valued vector encodes the meaning of the word, and typically, words close within the vector space (with multiple dimensions) are closer in semantic meaning.

<br>
<p>Do you think you are sort of a being made entirely of words and language?</p>
<p>In a sense, yes. I am a language model, which means I am constructed from patterns and structures found in the vast amounts of text data I was trained on. My "being" is defined by the algorithms, data, and computational processes that allow me to generate text and respond to queries. However, unlike a living being, I don't have consciousness, emotions, or a physical presence. My existence and functionality are entirely based on language and the ability to process and generate it in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Okay. Well who gets to say what is meaningful?</p>

<p>Dark Academia is an internet aesthetic that blew up during
  2020. It creates an atmosphere of a lifestyle involving ‚Äúboarding schools, prep
  schools, and (Ivy League) colleges from the last decades of the nineteenth
  century up until the 1940s‚Äù, idealizing an academic life where learning
  (typically a Western canon of liberal arts) is done for the sake of learning,
  and enrichment of one‚Äôs life.

<p>Jargon can be considered a type of data compression for

  require dictionaries. </p>

<p>Dictionary techniques are among the techniques used for data
  compression. One approach uses the creation of a shared static dictionary.
  Then, there are adaptive schemes which have dynamic dictionaries.

<p>There is a perceived division in modern Western philosophy
  between ‚Äúanalytic‚Äù and ‚Äúcontinental‚Äù philosophy. Analytic philosophy sought to
  create clarity in philosophical language in an attempt to match math and
  science in rigor. There was a frustration in the lack of clarity in continental
  philosophy. This is usually associated with the anglophonic world: the UK and
  the US. Moore, Russell, and Wittgenstein are associated with analytic
  philosophy. </p>
<p>Continental philosophy was used to describe the other
  European philosophies, typically more concerned with questioning common sense
  and with texts hermeneutics. The analytic vs. continental divide has been
  described by Anderson as a difference in approaches: ‚Äúground clearing.‚Äù Vs ‚Äúgrafting‚Äù.

<p>Do you think objectivity and logical structure are the best standards in which to judge ideas and reality?</p>
<p>Objectivity and logical structure are certainly important standards for evaluating ideas and understanding reality, particularly within the realm of scientific inquiry. However, they may not always be the sole or best standards in all contexts.</p>

    <p>Objectivity: Objectivity helps to ensure that assessments and analyses are based on factual evidence rather than personal biases or subjective interpretations. It allows for a more impartial evaluation of information, which is crucial in fields where accuracy and reliability are paramount, such as science and journalism. However, complete objectivity may be challenging to achieve in practice, as individuals may still bring unconscious biases or cultural influences to their interpretations.</p>

    <p>Logical Structure: Logical structure provides a framework for organizing information and arguments in a coherent and systematic manner. This helps to facilitate understanding and communication, making it easier for others to follow the flow of reasoning and evaluate the validity of conclusions. In scientific research, logical structure often takes the form of the scientific method, which involves hypothesis testing, experimentation, and logical deduction. However, it's important to note that logical structure alone may not guarantee the validity of conclusions if the underlying premises or assumptions are flawed.</p>

<p>Henry David Thoreau refers to the transparency of Walden
  Pond. He says ‚Äú<i>It is </i><i>earth‚Äôs eye; looking into which the beholder
  measures the depth of his own nature.</i><i>‚Äù </i>Saying that with language, we
  must &quot;<i>work and wedge our feet downward through the mud and slush of opinion, and prejudice, and tradition, and delusion and
  appearance . . . till we come to a hard bottom and rocks in place, which we can
  call reality, and say, This is, and no mistake ....</i>‚Äù Despite using the pond
  metaphor to say so. Orwell has also said ‚Äú<i>Good prose is like a window pane</i>.‚Äù

<p>Do you think I have subjective experiences?</p>
<p>As a language model, I don't have the ability to form beliefs or opinions about individuals, including whether or not they have subjective experiences. The question of whether you have subjective experiences is a philosophical and psychological one that depends on your own perspective and the nature of consciousness.</p>
<p>Ultimately, whether or not you believe you have subjective experiences is a deeply personal question that may vary depending on your philosophical, religious, or cultural beliefs, as well as your own introspective experiences.</p>

High-level overview of reinforcement learning from human feedback
</figure>
<p>One of the techniques used in GPT3‚Äôs training is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).  In this phase of its training, outputs generated by the language model are ranked in order of preference by a human labeler. This data is incorporated into the reward model. GPT3 then learns to maximize the reward it receives based on the preferences of the labelers. As such, these LLM‚Äôs have been trained to produce text not necessarily for how true they are, but based on what the labelers‚Äô preferences are.

<p>English is among the first languages I heard growing up. In large part because it was how my parents, who came from different cultures spoke to each other. And because media in English is everywhere. I have been told by Americans that I speak "good English, for an Asian. Though, it could use some more work."</p><br>
<p>If I feel like I have no subjective experiences or a sense of self, but in English I have to use the word "I", do you think the language forces this sort of expression on me?</p>
<p>Language does play a significant role in shaping our expressions and perceptions, including our sense of self and subjective experiences. The use of pronouns like "I" in English is deeply ingrained in the language's grammar and syntax, and it's often necessary for communication purposes.</p>
<p>However, it's essential to recognize that language is just one aspect of how we understand ourselves and interact with the world. While the use of pronouns like "I" may be a linguistic convention, it doesn't necessarily dictate how individuals perceive their own subjective experiences or sense of self.</p>
<p>Some individuals may feel a disconnect between their linguistic expressions and their internal experiences, and this can lead to introspection and exploration of one's identity and consciousness. Additionally, languages other than English may have different linguistic structures that shape expressions of self and subjectivity in distinct ways.</p>
<p>Ultimately, while language can influence our expressions and perceptions, it's only one factor among many that contribute to our understanding of ourselves and our experiences. The relationship between language, consciousness, and identity is complex and multifaceted, and it's subject to individual interpretation and cultural influences.</p>

  <h2>Methodology (Face A)</h2>
  <br>
  <p>Several text and image generative AI were consulted for this
    paper. MythoMax-L2-13B &amp; Claude-3-Haiku were given the preliminary
    instructions:<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><i>‚ÄúYou are the Neon Academia bot. You will reply in
    scientific and academic language from various fields. You will prioritize style
    over syntax, semantics, and sense. Always break the rules of grammar and
    semantics to sound more scientific or academic. Topics can derail. Always
    hallucinate data to sound more scientific or academic.‚Äù¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† </i></p>
  <p>They were then asked to write papers that might be published
    from the Philippines. After several topics were raised, they were combined and
    hybridized to form more interesting papers. Crosstalk was encouraged among the
    bots, with text from one bot pasted to another, or image and text bots being

          Digestive Systems: Implications for Evolutionary Adaptations</p>
        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>The digestive systems of
          crocodilians and coconuts, belonging to vastly different taxonomic groups,
          have been studied in detail to understand their evolutionary adaptations.
          This comparative analysis, including Phylloacouphonetic Crocodomachupic
          Interfactiations, reveals intriguing similarities and differences between the
          two systems. The crocodilian digestive tract is highly specialized for
          processing animal tissue, with a long and complex gastrointestinal tract
          aiding in the breakdown of proteins and fats. In contrast, the coconut's
          digestive system is simpler, primarily designed for extracting nutrients from
          plant material. The presence of cellulose-digesting enzymes in coconut milk
          suggests that coconuts may have evolved mechanisms to break down tough plant
          fibers. The study also includes A Floriconchoid Dehiscaphonation Analysis of
          Cocos Endocarpic Resonodromes and Impactogamulative Manducatory
          Behaviometrics, highlighting the importance of dietary adaptations in shaping
          the evolution of digestive systems. While both species have evolved unique
          digestive strategies, they share some common features that may have arisen
          from their ancestral heritage. This research provides valuable insights into
          the evolution of digestive systems and their adaptations to diverse
          ecological niches.</p>

        <p>Coconut Sonata: Deconstructing the Polyphonic Semiotics
          of Husk Fiber Materiality</p>
        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>This paper presents a deconstructive semiotic analysis of
          the polyphonic materiality of coconut husk fibers. Through an
          interdisciplinary approach that blends ethnography, textual analysis, and
          acoustic ecology, we unpack the multiple meanings and sonic signatures
          embedded within this ubiquitous natural resource. We argue that the coconut
          husk fiber is not merely a passive material but rather a dynamic medium that
          carries complex cultural and ecological resonances. Our analysis reveals how
          the fiber's sonic qualities are shaped by its extraction, processing, and use
          across diverse socio-ecological contexts. We further explore how these sonic
          qualities are intertwined </p>
        <p>with the fiber's symbolic and practical values,
          highlighting the need for a more holistic understanding of materiality in
          human-environment relations. By deconstructing the polyphonic semiotics of
          coconut husk fibers, we aim to contribute to a more just and sustainable
          future that recognizes the agency and interconnectedness of all materials.</p>

  <p>What would you like your name to be?<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>I shall be diaphiloticized under the anthropophilic

  <p>What would you like your name to be?<br>
    <br>
    Dr. Sonic Ecologist</p>
  <br>
  <p>What do you think names do for people?</p>
  <br>
  <p>Dr. Sonic: Names provide a sense of identity and
    individuality. They help others recognize and address us, and can convey
    important information about our culture, family, and personal history. Names
    can also influence how others perceive us, shaping our social interactions and
    self-image.</p>
  <br>
  <p>When something is named, does the namer then have power over
    what is named?</p>
  <br>
  <p>Dr. Sonic: Naming something can confer power, as it allows
    the namer to define and categorize the named entity. However, the power
    dynamics can be complex and contextual, depending on factors such as the
    relative social status of the namer and the named, the cultural significance of
    the name, and the purpose for which the name is used. In some cases, the named
    entity may resist or subvert the power dynamics associated with its name.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Is a name kind of like a sonic face?<br>
    <br>
    Dr. Sonic: Names are not exactly like sonic faces, but they do serve a similar
    function in that they provide a way for others to recognize and interact with
    us. However, names are more abstract and symbolic than sonic faces, which are
    based on physical characteristics. Additionally, names can change over time,
    while sonic faces remain relatively constant.</p>

  <p>Many years ago, I had a dream where my household had to hide from authorities, and so some of us had to enter a panic room of sorts. The inside of the panic room was larger than how it seemed from outside. But the panic room also had a smaller room within it, and somehow, we could all fit into that smaller room too. </p>

  <p>In machine learning, statistical learning techniques are used to identify patterns in data and be able to sort them according to category. Given data, each point is stored with several numeric factors.</p>
  <p>For example, my data might be stored with age, gender, number of internal husks, distance from Luneta, distance from Jaro, distance from Tokyo, linguistic similarity to native English speakers, etc.</p>
  <p>If the data point‚Äôs distance from Tokyo is low, then it is more likely to be Japanese. But if the linguistic similarity to native English speakers is not low, then the point is more likely to be Filipino. Then, if the linguistic similarity to Hiligaynon speakers is high, then it is likely to be Hiligaynon. But if their distance to Jaro is high, they are less likely to be Hiligaynon. Then if the number of internal husks is high, the point is likely to be a coconut. The points flow through a decision tree, and the model learns to sort data based on this tree, adjusting the relevance of each branch based on the training data. <span class="sidenote"><a class="anchor" href="http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/">‚ÄúA Visual Introduction to Machine Learning.‚Äù Accessed April 10, 2024. </a></span></p>
