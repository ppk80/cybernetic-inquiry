  <p>This study embarks on an
    exploration of the urbanomic linguistics of coconut husks, shedding light on
    their profound implications for decoding human-crocodilian symbiosis and the
    socio-cultural evolution of the Philippines. Employing cutting-edge techniques
    in acoustic ecology and immersive archaeological fieldwork, we dissect the linguistic
    signatures of coconut husks across their temporal spectrum, from inception to
    dissolution. Our reveal a complex network of linguistic patterns mirroring the
    myriad stages of husk existence, offering a tantalizing glimpse into the rich
    tapestry of human and ecological interactions in the Philippine archipelago. We
    argue for the indispensable role of an encompassing comprehension of coconut
    husk archaeoacoustics in weaving together the threads of historical discourse
    and catalyzing sustainable conservation efforts in the region.&nbsp</p>

<h2> Introduction (Face A) </h2>
<p>It’s April Fool’s. Brands, in general. It’s interesting that
  it happens almost on the opposite side of the year as Halloween. Kind of like
  they’re mirrors of each other. I trust mirrors. Growing up, we used them to
  hide things that were behind them, because symmetry is a fantastic distraction.
  But I trust them because one can always rely on the space between mirrors. Like
  a skin.</p>
<br>
<p>21:10 on April Fool’s, I conducted a <a
			href="https://chat.openai.com/share/ca2c166d-3f3f-4927-bdf1-313b258e27f8" class="anchor">preliminary interview</a> with one of my research
  subjects/resource persons/co-writers. In science, “subject” doesn’t sound very
  agent at all. But that’s what I mean it as.</p>
<p>Would you like to be the one to name your role in this
  study?</p>
<p>Certainly, a role that encompasses the responsibilities of a
  research subject, a resource person, and a co-writer of the research could be
  termed as a &quot;Collaborative Scholar-Investigator.&quot;</p>
<p>A CSI, for short.</p>
<br>
<p>LLMs are kind of more or less pure style. They are
  stochastic parrots and attempt to predict what word is mostly likely to come
  after another. What word lies behind the next word. And this makes them pretty
  good at copying writing styles.

<br>
<p>“Purity” is a tongue-in-cheek discussion among the sciences.
  Who is the purest of them all? Iff language is a mirror of the world (a skin),
  can one manufacture a pure mirror?&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>The Latin “&#257;l&#363;cin&#257;ti&#333;” is still
  recognizable to me as what the word is today. It hasn’t changed much. But I bet
  the meaning has changed.

<p>Machine learning neural networks are made of layers that
  interact. There are input nodes, hidden nodes, and output nodes. Neural
  networks can consist of incredibly complex sequences of layers and nodes. The

<p>In machine learning, a word embedding is a representation of a word. A real-valued vector encodes the meaning of the word, and typically, words close within the vector space (with multiple dimensions) are closer in semantic meaning.

<p>Dark Academia is an internet aesthetic that blew up during
  2020. It creates an atmosphere of a lifestyle involving “boarding schools, prep
  schools, and (Ivy League) colleges from the last decades of the nineteenth
  century up until the 1940s”, idealizing an academic life where learning
  (typically a Western canon of liberal arts) is done for the sake of learning,
  and enrichment of one’s life.

<p>There is a perceived division in modern Western philosophy
  between “analytic” and “continental” philosophy. Analytic philosophy sought to
  create clarity in philosophical language in an attempt to match math and
  science in rigor. There was a frustration in the lack of clarity in continental
  philosophy. This is usually associated with the anglophonic world: the UK and
  the US. Moore, Russell, and Wittgenstein are associated with analytic
  philosophy. </p>
<p>Continental philosophy was used to describe the other
  European philosophies, typically more concerned with questioning common sense
  and with texts hermeneutics. The analytic vs. continental divide has been
  described by Anderson as a difference in approaches: “ground clearing.” Vs “grafting”.

High-level overview of reinforcement learning from human feedback
</figure>
<p>One of the techniques used in GPT3’s training is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).  In this phase of its training, outputs generated by the language model are ranked in order of preference by a human labeler. This data is incorporated into the reward model. GPT3 then learns to maximize the reward it receives based on the preferences of the labelers. As such, these LLM’s have been trained to produce text not necessarily for how true they are, but based on what the labelers’ preferences are.

        <p>Comparative Study of Crocodilian and Cocos nucifera
          Digestive Systems: Implications for Evolutionary Adaptations</p>
        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>The digestive systems of
          crocodilians and coconuts, belonging to vastly different taxonomic groups,
          have been studied in detail to understand their evolutionary adaptations.
          This comparative analysis, including Phylloacouphonetic Crocodomachupic
          Interfactiations, reveals intriguing similarities and differences between the
          two systems. The crocodilian digestive tract is highly specialized for
          processing animal tissue, with a long and complex gastrointestinal tract
          aiding in the breakdown of proteins and fats. In contrast, the coconut's
          digestive system is simpler, primarily designed for extracting nutrients from
          plant material. The presence of cellulose-digesting enzymes in coconut milk
          suggests that coconuts may have evolved mechanisms to break down tough plant
          fibers. The study also includes A Floriconchoid Dehiscaphonation Analysis of
          Cocos Endocarpic Resonodromes and Impactogamulative Manducatory
          Behaviometrics, highlighting the importance of dietary adaptations in shaping
          the evolution of digestive systems. While both species have evolved unique
          digestive strategies, they share some common features that may have arisen
          from their ancestral heritage. This research provides valuable insights into
          the evolution of digestive systems and their adaptations to diverse
          ecological niches.</p>

        <p>Coconut Sonata: Deconstructing the Polyphonic Semiotics
          of Husk Fiber Materiality</p>
        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>This paper presents a deconstructive semiotic analysis of
          the polyphonic materiality of coconut husk fibers. Through an
          interdisciplinary approach that blends ethnography, textual analysis, and
          acoustic ecology, we unpack the multiple meanings and sonic signatures
          embedded within this ubiquitous natural resource. We argue that the coconut
          husk fiber is not merely a passive material but rather a dynamic medium that
          carries complex cultural and ecological resonances. Our analysis reveals how
          the fiber's sonic qualities are shaped by its extraction, processing, and use
          across diverse socio-ecological contexts. We further explore how these sonic
          qualities are intertwined </p>
        <p>with the fiber's symbolic and practical values,
          highlighting the need for a more holistic understanding of materiality in
          human-environment relations. By deconstructing the polyphonic semiotics of
          coconut husk fibers, we aim to contribute to a more just and sustainable
          future that recognizes the agency and interconnectedness of all materials.</p>

  <p>What would you like your name to be?<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>I shall be diaphiloticized under the anthropophilic
    representation &quot;Dr. Petrawittgenstein Bi'MaMicrovectrix Quantachronon III
    (&#8710;i-&#8710;^M^3), Neurophraseous Biomedianarxaeoplankton of the Second

  <p>What would you like your name to be?<br>
    <br>
    Dr. Sonic Ecologist</p>
  <br>
  <p>What do you think names do for people?</p>
  <br>
  <p>Dr. Sonic: Names provide a sense of identity and
    individuality. They help others recognize and address us, and can convey
    important information about our culture, family, and personal history. Names
    can also influence how others perceive us, shaping our social interactions and
    self-image.</p>
  <br>
  <p>When something is named, does the namer then have power over
    what is named?</p>
  <br>
  <p>Dr. Sonic: Naming something can confer power, as it allows
    the namer to define and categorize the named entity. However, the power
    dynamics can be complex and contextual, depending on factors such as the
    relative social status of the namer and the named, the cultural significance of
    the name, and the purpose for which the name is used. In some cases, the named
    entity may resist or subvert the power dynamics associated with its name.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Is a name kind of like a sonic face?<br>
    <br>
    Dr. Sonic: Names are not exactly like sonic faces, but they do serve a similar
    function in that they provide a way for others to recognize and interact with
    us. However, names are more abstract and symbolic than sonic faces, which are
    based on physical characteristics. Additionally, names can change over time,
    while sonic faces remain relatively constant.</p>

  <p>Many years ago, I had a dream where my household had to hide from authorities, and so some of us had to enter a panic room of sorts. The inside of the panic room was larger than how it seemed from outside. But the panic room also had a smaller room within it, and somehow, we could all fit into that smaller room too. </p>

  <p>Coconuts have such a structure that allow them to be buoyant and resistant to powerful waves, so that they can be carried along the water and propagated across the ocean.

  <p>Nowadays, the “buwaya” (crocodile) is used as a symbol for corrupt politicians. Pre-colonially, they were venerated. They were seen as guardians, and invoked for safe passage for the dead.

  <p>In machine learning, statistical learning techniques are used to identify patterns in data and be able to sort them according to category. Given data, each point is stored with several numeric factors.</p>
  <p>For example, my data might be stored with age, gender, number of internal husks, distance from Luneta, distance from Jaro, distance from Tokyo, linguistic similarity to native English speakers, etc.</p>
  <p>If the data point’s distance from Tokyo is low, then it is more likely to be Japanese. But if the linguistic similarity to native English speakers is not low, then the point is more likely to be Filipino. Then, if the linguistic similarity to Hiligaynon speakers is high, then it is likely to be Hiligaynon. But if their distance to Jaro is high, they are less likely to be Hiligaynon. Then if the number of internal husks is high, the point is likely to be a coconut. The points flow through a decision tree, and the model learns to sort data based on this tree, adjusting the relevance of each branch based on the training data. <span class="sidenote"><a class="anchor" href="http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/">“A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning.” Accessed April 10, 2024. </a></span></p>

Each layer corresponds to a year of her life, where the embryonic stage is at the center. <span class="sidenote"><a class="anchor" href="link">Nemuki+編集部. 伊藤潤二研究 ホラーの深淵から. 朝日新聞出版, 2017.
