			<h1>Cybernetic Inquiry into the Urbanomic Linguistics of Coconut Husk Archaeoacoustics: Illuminating Crocodilian Dynamics and Techno-Ethnographic Tellscape Analysis</h1>

			<p>This study embarks on an
			exploration of the urbanomic linguistics of coconut husks, shedding light on
			their profound implications for decoding human-crocodilian symbiosis and the
			socio-cultural evolution of the Philippines. Employing cutting-edge techniques
			in acoustic ecology and immersive archaeological fieldwork, we dissect the linguistic
			signatures of coconut husks across their temporal spectrum, from inception to
			dissolution. Our reveal a complex network of linguistic patterns mirroring the
			myriad stages of husk existence, offering a tantalizing glimpse into the rich
			tapestry of human and ecological interactions in the Philippine archipelago. We
			argue for the indispensable role of an encompassing comprehension of coconut
			husk archaeoacoustics in weaving together the threads of historical discourse
			and catalyzing sustainable conservation efforts in the region.</p>

			<p>It‚Äôs April Fool‚Äôs. Brands, in general. It‚Äôs interesting that
			it happens almost on the opposite side of the year as Halloween. Kind of like
			they‚Äôre mirrors of each other. I trust mirrors. Growing up, we used them to
			hide things that were behind them, because symmetry is a fantastic distraction.
			But I trust them because one can always rely on the space between mirrors. Like
			a skin.</p>
			<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class=MsoNormal>21:10 on April Fool‚Äôs, I conducted a <a

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class=MsoNormal>Would you like to be the one to name your role in this
			study?</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>Certainly, a role that encompasses the responsibilities of a

			<p class=MsoNormal>A CSI, for short.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class=MsoNormal>LLMs are kind of more or less pure style. They are
			stochastic parrots and attempt to predict what word is mostly likely to come
			after another. What word lies behind the next word. And this makes them pretty
			good at copying writing styles. <label for="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a class="anchor" href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=WM44GOoQPb4">Guo, Xu, and Ritter, ‚ÄúMeta-Tuning LLMs to Elicit Lexical Knowledge of Language Style.‚Äù</a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a perceived division in modern Western philosophy
between ‚Äúanalytic‚Äù and ‚Äúcontinental‚Äù philosophy. Analytic philosophy sought to
create clarity in philosophical language in an attempt to match math and
science in rigor. There was a frustration in the lack of clarity in continental
philosophy. This is usually associated with the anglophonic world: the UK and
the US. Moore, Russell, and Wittgenstein are associated with analytic
philosophy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>




<p class=MsoNormal>Continental philosophy was used to describe the other
European philosophies, typically more concerned with questioning common sense
and with texts hermeneutics. The analytic vs. continental divide has been
described by Anderson as a difference in approaches: ‚Äúground clearing.‚Äù Vs ‚Äúgrafting‚Äù.

<p>One of the techniques used in GPT3‚Äôs training is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).  In this phase of its training, outputs generated by the language model are ranked in order of preference by a human labeler. This data is incorporated into the reward model. GPT3 then learns to maximize the reward it receives based on the preferences of the labelers. As such, these LLM‚Äôs have been trained to produce text not necessarily for how true they are, but based on what the labelers‚Äô preferences are.  For OpenAI and ChatGPT, this work was outsourced to Kenya. </p>
