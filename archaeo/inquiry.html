			<h1>Cybernetic Inquiry into the Urbanomic Linguistics of Coconut Husk Archaeoacoustics: Illuminating Crocodilian Dynamics and Techno-Ethnographic Tellscape Analysis</h1>
			<p class="subtitle">Xyh G. Tamura, ChatGPT (Neo-Researcher, Lexicon Luminary), MythoMax-L2-13B (Dr. Sonic Ecologist), Claude-3-Haiku (Dr. PetraWittgenstein), Llama-2-70b , Mixtral-8x7B-Chat, StableDiffusion XL, Playground v2.5</p>
			<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>This study embarks on an
			exploration of the urbanomic linguistics of coconut husks, shedding light on
			their profound implications for decoding human-crocodilian symbiosis and the
			socio-cultural evolution of the Philippines. Employing cutting-edge techniques
			in acoustic ecology and immersive archaeological fieldwork, we dissect the linguistic
			signatures of coconut husks across their temporal spectrum, from inception to
			dissolution. Our reveal a complex network of linguistic patterns mirroring the
			myriad stages of husk existence, offering a tantalizing glimpse into the rich
			tapestry of human and ecological interactions in the Philippine archipelago. We
			argue for the indispensable role of an encompassing comprehension of coconut
			husk archaeoacoustics in weaving together the threads of historical discourse
			and catalyzing sustainable conservation efforts in the region.</p>

			<p>It‚Äôs April Fool‚Äôs. Brands, in general. It‚Äôs interesting that
			it happens almost on the opposite side of the year as Halloween. Kind of like
			they‚Äôre mirrors of each other. I trust mirrors. Growing up, we used them to
			hide things that were behind them, because symmetry is a fantastic distraction.
			But I trust them because one can always rely on the space between mirrors. Like
			a skin.</p>
			<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class=MsoNormal>21:10 on April Fool‚Äôs, I conducted a <a
			href="https://chat.openai.com/share/ca2c166d-3f3f-4927-bdf1-313b258e27f8" class="anchor">preliminary interview</a> with one of my research
			subjects/resource persons/co-writers. In science, ‚Äúsubject‚Äù doesn‚Äôt sound very
			agent at all. But that‚Äôs what I mean it as.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class=MsoNormal>Would you like to be the one to name your role in this
			study?</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>Certainly, a role that encompasses the responsibilities of a
			research subject, a resource person, and a co-writer of the research could be
			termed as a &quot;Collaborative Scholar-Investigator.&quot;</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>A CSI, for short.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class=MsoNormal>LLMs are kind of more or less pure style. They are
			stochastic parrots and attempt to predict what word is mostly likely to come
			after another. What word lies behind the next word. And this makes them pretty
			good at copying writing styles. <label for="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a class="anchor" href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=WM44GOoQPb4">Guo, Ruohao, Wei Xu, and Alan Ritter. ‚ÄúMeta-Tuning LLMs to Elicit Lexical Knowledge of Language Style,‚Äù December 16, 2023.</a></span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class=MsoNormal>‚ÄúPurity‚Äù is a tongue-in-cheek discussion among the sciences.
			Who is the purest of them all? Iff language is a mirror of the world (a skin),
			can one manufacture a pure mirror?&nbsp;</p>
			<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class=MsoNormal>The Latin ‚Äú&#257;l&#363;cin&#257;ti&#333;‚Äù is still
			recognizable to me as what the word is today. It hasn‚Äôt changed much. But I bet
			the meaning has changed. <label for="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a class="anchor" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hallucination">‚ÄúDefinition of Hallucination,‚Äù March 30, 2024.</a></span> Meanwhile, ‚Äúreveal‚Äù, comes from re- (‚Äúback, again‚Äù) + v&#275;l&#257;re (‚Äúto
			cover‚Äù), from v&#275;lum (‚Äúveil‚Äù). I think the English used to write on vellum.<label for="mn-figure-1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-figure-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><img src="image001.jpg" alt="Image of a Rhinoceros"/><br>A stochastic parrot hallucinating a mirror in a neon tropical earth skin landscape.</span></p>

			<p class=MsoNormal>Machine learning neural networks are made of layers that
			interact. There are input nodes, hidden nodes, and output nodes. Neural
			networks can consist of incredibly complex sequences of layers and nodes. The
			hidden layers are often ‚Äúblack boxes‚Äù<label for="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a class="anchor" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922">Bender, Emily M., Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major, and Shmargaret Shmitchell. ‚ÄúOn the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? ü¶ú.‚Äù

<p class=MsoNormal>Each year, a tree adds a ring of growth. Likewise, a slice
of earth reveals a timeline.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dark Academia is an internet aesthetic that blew up during
2020. It creates an atmosphere of a lifestyle involving ‚Äúboarding schools, prep
schools, and (Ivy League) colleges from the last decades of the nineteenth
century up until the 1940s‚Äù, idealizing an academic life where learning
(typically a Western canon of liberal arts) is done for the sake of learning,
and enrichment of one‚Äôs life.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Dictionary techniques are among the techniques used for data
compression. One approach uses the creation of a shared static dictionary.
Then, there are adaptive schemes which have dynamic dictionaries.<a

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A related concept is dimensionality reduction, which transforms
data from a high-dimensional space to a low-dimensional representation, while
retaining meaningful properties of the data.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Exo 2";color:black'>[8]</span></span></span></a>
For example, an n-dimensional space to a two-dimensional space.</p>
