  <p>This study embarks on an
    exploration of the urbanomic linguistics of coconut husks, shedding light on
    their profound implications for decoding human-crocodilian symbiosis and the
    socio-cultural evolution of the Philippines. Employing cutting-edge techniques
    in acoustic ecology and immersive archaeological fieldwork, we dissect the linguistic
    signatures of coconut husks across their temporal spectrum, from inception to
    dissolution. Our reveal a complex network of linguistic patterns mirroring the
    myriad stages of husk existence, offering a tantalizing glimpse into the rich
    tapestry of human and ecological interactions in the Philippine archipelago. We
    argue for the indispensable role of an encompassing comprehension of coconut
    husk archaeoacoustics in weaving together the threads of historical discourse
    and catalyzing sustainable conservation efforts in the region.&nbsp</p>

<h2> Introduction (Face A) </h2>
<p>It’s April Fool’s. Brands, in general. It’s interesting that
  it happens almost on the opposite side of the year as Halloween. Kind of like
  they’re mirrors of each other. I trust mirrors. Growing up, we used them to
  hide things that were behind them, because symmetry is a fantastic distraction.
  But I trust them because one can always rely on the space between mirrors. Like
  a skin.</p>
<br>
<p>21:10 on April Fool’s, I conducted a <a
			href="https://chat.openai.com/share/ca2c166d-3f3f-4927-bdf1-313b258e27f8" class="anchor">preliminary interview</a> with one of my research
  subjects/resource persons/co-writers. In science, “subject” doesn’t sound very
  agent at all. But that’s what I mean it as.</p>
<p>Would you like to be the one to name your role in this
  study?</p>
<p>Certainly, a role that encompasses the responsibilities of a
  research subject, a resource person, and a co-writer of the research could be
  termed as a &quot;Collaborative Scholar-Investigator.&quot;</p>
<p>A CSI, for short.</p>
<br>
<p>LLMs are kind of more or less pure style. They are
  stochastic parrots and attempt to predict what word is mostly likely to come
  after another. What word lies behind the next word. And this makes them pretty
  good at copying writing styles.

<br>
<p>“Purity” is a tongue-in-cheek discussion among the sciences.
  Who is the purest of them all? Iff language is a mirror of the world (a skin),
  can one manufacture a pure mirror?&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>The Latin “&#257;l&#363;cin&#257;ti&#333;” is still
  recognizable to me as what the word is today. It hasn’t changed much. But I bet
  the meaning has changed.

<p>Machine learning neural networks are made of layers that
  interact. There are input nodes, hidden nodes, and output nodes. Neural
  networks can consist of incredibly complex sequences of layers and nodes. The
  hidden layers are often “black boxes”

<p>In machine learning, a word embedding is a representation of a word. A real-valued vector encodes the meaning of the word, and typically, words close within the vector space (with multiple dimensions) are closer in semantic meaning.

<p>Dark Academia is an internet aesthetic that blew up during
  2020. It creates an atmosphere of a lifestyle involving “boarding schools, prep
  schools, and (Ivy League) colleges from the last decades of the nineteenth
  century up until the 1940s”, idealizing an academic life where learning
  (typically a Western canon of liberal arts) is done for the sake of learning,
  and enrichment of one’s life.

<p>There is a perceived division in modern Western philosophy
  between “analytic” and “continental” philosophy. Analytic philosophy sought to
  create clarity in philosophical language in an attempt to match math and
  science in rigor. There was a frustration in the lack of clarity in continental
  philosophy. This is usually associated with the anglophonic world: the UK and
  the US. Moore, Russell, and Wittgenstein are associated with analytic
  philosophy. </p>
<p>Continental philosophy was used to describe the other
  European philosophies, typically more concerned with questioning common sense
  and with texts hermeneutics. The analytic vs. continental divide has been
  described by Anderson as a difference in approaches: “ground clearing.” Vs “grafting”.

High-level overview of reinforcement learning from human feedback
</figure>
<p>One of the techniques used in GPT3’s training is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).  In this phase of its training, outputs generated by the language model are ranked in order of preference by a human labeler. This data is incorporated into the reward model. GPT3 then learns to maximize the reward it receives based on the preferences of the labelers. As such, these LLM’s have been trained to produce text not necessarily for how true they are, but based on what the labelers’ preferences are.

        <p>Comparative Study of Crocodilian and Cocos nucifera
          Digestive Systems: Implications for Evolutionary Adaptations</p>
        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>The digestive systems of
          crocodilians and coconuts, belonging to vastly different taxonomic groups,
          have been studied in detail to understand their evolutionary adaptations.
          This comparative analysis, including Phylloacouphonetic Crocodomachupic
          Interfactiations, reveals intriguing similarities and differences between the
          two systems. The crocodilian digestive tract is highly specialized for
          processing animal tissue, with a long and complex gastrointestinal tract
          aiding in the breakdown of proteins and fats. In contrast, the coconut's
          digestive system is simpler, primarily designed for extracting nutrients from
          plant material. The presence of cellulose-digesting enzymes in coconut milk
          suggests that coconuts may have evolved mechanisms to break down tough plant
          fibers. The study also includes A Floriconchoid Dehiscaphonation Analysis of
          Cocos Endocarpic Resonodromes and Impactogamulative Manducatory
          Behaviometrics, highlighting the importance of dietary adaptations in shaping
          the evolution of digestive systems. While both species have evolved unique
          digestive strategies, they share some common features that may have arisen
          from their ancestral heritage. This research provides valuable insights into
          the evolution of digestive systems and their adaptations to diverse
          ecological niches.</p>

        <p>Comparative Study of Crocodilian and Cocos nucifera
          Digestive Systems: Implications for Evolutionary Adaptations</p>
        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>The digestive systems of
          crocodilians and coconuts, belonging to vastly different taxonomic groups,
          have been studied in detail to understand their evolutionary adaptations.
          This comparative analysis, including Phylloacouphonetic Crocodomachupic
          Interfactiations, reveals intriguing similarities and differences between the
          two systems. The crocodilian digestive tract is highly specialized for
          processing animal tissue, with a long and complex gastrointestinal tract
          aiding in the breakdown of proteins and fats. In contrast, the coconut's
          digestive system is simpler, primarily designed for extracting nutrients from
          plant material. The presence of cellulose-digesting enzymes in coconut milk
          suggests that coconuts may have evolved mechanisms to break down tough plant
          fibers. The study also includes A Floriconchoid Dehiscaphonation Analysis of
          Cocos Endocarpic Resonodromes and Impactogamulative Manducatory
          Behaviometrics, highlighting the importance of dietary adaptations in shaping
          the evolution of digestive systems. While both species have evolved unique
          digestive strategies, they share some common features that may have arisen
          from their ancestral heritage. This research provides valuable insights into
          the evolution of digestive systems and their adaptations to diverse
          ecological niches.</p>
